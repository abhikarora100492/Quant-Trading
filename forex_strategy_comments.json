They don't know you, how dare they blame you for anything.\nI started with manual trading and ended up as an algorithmic trader. I automated and tested literally 120+ strategies including news utilizing strategies over 18 years of data. My conclusion is that the forex market is very noisy. There are a lot of randomness in the price movements, at all practical time scales, which don't really correlate to anything else. All the pattern based entry and exit strategies don't really work. They may be profitable for a period of time out of luck. It has nothing to do with psychology because my test programs don't have emotions. None of the price actions or indicators has predictive power in short term. I am quoting out of my experience, not from any book. This is the reason that many algo traders avoid forex.\nI am not saying there are no profitable manual traders. I can't prove it either way. Who am I to condemn everyone. I am just saying I gave up on manual, technical or fundamental trading, and highly skeptical if anyone can.\nAlgo trading is the way for me. The approach has to be statistical meaning you can't say which trade will win, but you can say what percentage of your trade will win. Because I found the market statistics don't change too much in a year to year basis. So, learn programming, statistics, probability and make an algo trading machine for yourself.",

If he sucks at executing the strategy and strategically setting stop losses, OP needs to figure out what he is doing wrong and correct it. This takes practice and it takes hard work. It's like playing guitar, 99.9999% of the population are not prodigy guitar players. Some of the best guitar players sucked when they first started and they had to spend hours upon hours practicing.",

If you implemented that strategy you'd be right 50% of the time over a long period of time.

Obviously, don't jump strategies too often but you still have to use both back and forward testing to see the tiny tweaks you need to change. Think of it like using the scientific method and having very micro, marginal changes over time.\n\nAnd example for me was: I had gotten out of a massive losing streak with the strategy I currently use (which losing streaks are normal and don't mean anything is wrong). However, my profits were still coming in very very slowly. I had been using a 1:1 rr. My win rate was 50%. But i saw that during my wins, the charts would often go pass my tp. Hypothesis: raising my rr from 1:1 to 1:1.5 would decrease my win rate but make my profits bigger. I forward tested it on a fake account for a while and my win rate dropped to around 35-40ish%. Then over time, I noticed it would still blow pass my tp, wash, rinse, and repeat.\n\nI did that with other things about my strategy as well but long story short, be a scientist.",

Which means that you have to find and craft your own unique edge.\n\nYou mentioned that you daytrading, use basic SnR strategy, journaling every trades and use fixed % risk per trade with fixed number of trades per day, no strat hopping, all of which is very good. I will assume that you experience the slowly account bleed and/or reaching breakeven trading phases (which is also very good, break even phase is one of the hardest/longest phase to stay in, in my experience).\n\nRight now you will need some more factors to reach profitability, one is more backtesting, two is use your backtesting data to adjust/further tuning your strategy, three is when you done before steps you will need to mental check where your now updated-strategy aligns with your liking, your attention span and your risk tolerance. \n\nThen you get to the printing money phase.\n\nI believe to reach this profitable phase a trader must have skillset where almost all factors at good/high level. If one of them is missing or weak, it will drag performance down to breakeven phase.\n\nEdit: sorry you already said you are breakeven but I accidentally skip that last words, I should not assume any experience that you are in, my bad.",
